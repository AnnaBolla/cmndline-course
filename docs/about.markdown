## Anna Bolla

Something of a CV goes here.

I am 21 years old, studying Hungarian and English literature and grammar at the [Eötvös Lóránd University](https://elte.hu) in Budapest. I'd like to be an English and Hungarian language teacher when I finish my Master's degree. I love travelling, photography, good music.
