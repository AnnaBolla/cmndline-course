## Anna Bolla

I am 21 years old, studying Hungarian and English literature and grammar at the [Eötvös Loránd University](https://elte.hu) in Budapest. I'd like to be an English and Hungarian language teacher when I finish my Master's degree. I love to travel, listening to music and going to the gym, these are my stress reliefers. I have a wonderful and supporting family, two sisters and a brother + parents. I love taking pictures, especially of very cute dogs and beautiful nature. In the future my main aim is to have a big family close to the nature, hills. The sentence that describes me the most is Better late then never.

I have a loving family, they support me in all of my dreams and studies. I am a red belt martial artist  in shaolin kung fu, this sport is my main hobby and passion. I also love skiing, and in the future I would like to becomme not only a kung fu trainer but also a skiing instructior. The sentence that describes me the best is If you can do it today do not leave it tomorrow. :)
