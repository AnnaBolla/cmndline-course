### Introduction
## Hi!
We are Anna and Luca, two Hungarian exchange students in Helsinki, Finland. 
Our home university is the Eötvös Loránd Tudományegyetem (ELTE) in Budapest.
We are studying to become Hungarian and English secondary school teachers, but here for 4 months we are attending 
English major programme at the University of Helsinki. 
Our favourite activities together are doing sports; especially gym trainings, 
kettlebell and body pump classes, plus we love to eat (a lot). 
We are between the extroverts and introverts, we like people, but not always,
we love to sit outside with a cup of coffee and judging others.
Our main characteristic features are being short, blonde, having loud laughter and 
being very beginners for command line course.
